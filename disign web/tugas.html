                <div class="text">I can't think of a place I would rather be than the forest. I think one of the best ways to enjoy and explore the forest is hiking. I have two little ones who are generally with me when I am hiking, so I am always looking for ways to keep things interesting and fun for them. One of the best ways I have found to entertain kids while hiking it help them learn how to explore the world around them, and the part is you don't need any extra equipment.

                <div class="text">Ocean exploration is about making discoveries, searching for things that are unusual and unexpected. Ocean exploration, however, is not randomly wandering in hopes of finding something new. It is disciplined, systematic, and includes rigorous observations and documentation of biological, chemical, physical, geological, and archaeological aspects of the ocean. And, most of our knowledge of the ocean lies in shallower waters.</div>
